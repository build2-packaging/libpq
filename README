PostgreSQL is an object-relational SQL database management system with libpq
being its C client library. Applications can use this library to pass queries
to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of those queries
using the C programming language. For more information see:

https://www.postgresql.org/

This package currently contains a build2 package manager (bpkg) stub meaning
that it can only be "built" as already installed in the underlying system (for
example, using a system package manager).

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the PostgreSQL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback
to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of PostgreSQL for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/postgresql/
