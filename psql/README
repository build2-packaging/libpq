PostgreSQL is an object-relational SQL database management system with psql
being its terminal-based front-end. It enables the user to type in queries
interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.
Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments. For
more information see:

https://www.postgresql.org/

This package contains the original psql program source code overlaid with the
build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the program itself to
the PostgreSQL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback
to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of PostgreSQL for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/postgresql/
