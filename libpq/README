PostgreSQL is an object-relational SQL database management system with libpq
being its C client library. Applications can use this library to pass queries
to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of those queries
using the C programming language. For more information see:

https://www.postgresql.org/

This package contains the original libpq library source code overlaid with the
build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the PostgreSQL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback
to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of PostgreSQL for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/postgresql/
